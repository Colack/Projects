!! Warning: !!
Gold currently only runs on Windows. We are looking for a way to get it running on Linux/MacOs.
You can try running Gold using a Linux/MacOs MS Powershell Distro, but it will probably be filled with bugs.
Linux - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-linux?view=powershell-7.2
MacOs - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-macos?view=powershell-7.2

# Information #

The Gold Programming language is a lightweight, Programming language, using a Python/JavaScript interpreter to run.
It gets update frequently, with a update coming out every ~1-2 weeks. You can download a version of the language at 
https://github.com/Shining-Gold-Studios/Gold-Language/releases, or you can go to https://colack.github.io/projects/gold .
(Its the quicker link anyway.)

# Getting Started #

There are 3 simple tools you need to run/create Gold programs. 

1. A text editor.
We would recommend VsCode, but notepad works fine too.

2. A Distribution of NodeJS/Python.
The Python Version is currently still being worked on, but the NodeJS Version is working fine.
NodeJs - https://nodejs.org/en/
Python - https://www.python.org/

3. A Distribution of Gold
You can get a Release from the Link above, or you can clone this repository locally;
https://github.com/Shining-Gold-Studios/Gold-Installer-Repo

If you have all 3 of these tools, you should be good to go.
