# Orbital

Here it is, the Official mirror of the Original Orbital code.   

Check out the license for more information on copying the code.

## Information

Orbital was a Discord bot I was working on back in ~Summer 2021. The bot shut down due to server management and long coding times, but now all of the code is for you to take. Do whatever you want with it.

## Installation

To run the bot, you will need a couple packages.

* axios
* express
* discord.js
* @iamtraction/google-translate

When running the bot, use the following command:

```javascript
node .
```
