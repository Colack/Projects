# HelloWorld

This is a project that is probably going to take me well over ~5 years. 

## The Plan

Simply enough, I am going to write the simple `Hello World!` program in every single coding language ever! 
This is something that I have always wanted to do, and is a journey that will lead me down many confusing languages. 

ðŸ™‚ Join me on this Journey. ðŸ™‚
