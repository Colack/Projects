<p>Steven and The Quest to Save the Climate, or SATQTSTC was my first ever video game, and the story behind the game is even more interesting than the game itself. 
For the rest of this document, I&#39;m going to be referring to it as Steven.</p>
<h2 id="starting-point">Starting Point</h2>
<p>The Original idea for Steven came from my sister. She was playing with some simple toys in her room, and she told a story about a hero stopping a Dragon from blowing smoke.
This sparked the idea for the game.</p>
<p>We had a upcoming project in my computer science class, and we needed to come up with a project within a week. 
I told the people on my team about the game idea, and we all agreed that we should make the game.</p>
<p>The roles were simple.</p>
<ul>
<li>Colack: Developer</li>
<li>Derelicte: Stylist/Sprites</li>
<li>Dark: Ideas + Story</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>The Development of the game started on a Monday. 
Dark came up with the name of the main Character: Steven.</p>
<p>We originally had an giant level plan for the game, but that got cancelled due to time constraints.
The original game was going to play out like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>You control the character with the Arrow keys, and space is to slash your sword.</li>
<li>There would be Five levels:<br><br>
Plains<br><br>
Cave
<br>
Tower
<br>
Bridge 
<br>
Castle
<br></li>
</ul>
<p>There was also supposed to be a lot of enemies, but that got scrapped too.</p>
<p>Most of the coding Process was just menus, but Math was also a big role.</p>
<p>And thats the story behind the game! </p>
<p>It was such a fun Journey to be in, and I hope you guys enjoyed. </p>
