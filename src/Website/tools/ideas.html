<h2 id="character-design">Character Design</h2>
<p>Give each character some sort of design that makes them different from each other.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Example:</li>
</ul>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Character</th>
<th>Race</th>
<th>Gender</th>
<th>Quote</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Warrior</td>
<td>Human</td>
<td>Male</td>
<td>&quot;That Dang Dragon!&quot;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Archer</td>
<td>Elf</td>
<td>Female</td>
<td>&quot;You need an arrow?&quot;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Knight</td>
<td>Goblin</td>
<td>Male</td>
<td>&quot;No, I&#39;m not a enemie.&quot;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2 id="enemie-design">Enemie Design</h2>
<p>Make enemies different from each other, with different stats and personalities.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goblins are angry, and have big sharp teeth.</li>
<li>Spiders screech very lowdly, and can climb on walls.</li>
<li>Ogres are like onions, they have layers.</li>
<li>Centaurs are extremely fast, watch out for them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="weapon-armor-system">Weapon/Armor System</h2>
<p>Allow players to gather Weapons and Armor, to increase stats and such.<br>This would go well with the Army system in the game, as players would feel the need to gather weapons for the army, leaning to a longer game time. <em>(Maybe implement a other style of play for shorter, less grindy games?)</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Copper Sword</strong></li>
<li><strong>Iron Sword</strong></li>
<li><strong>Rusty Shovel</strong></li>
<li><strong>Stick and Boot</strong></li>
<li><strong>Jacks Hammer of Debugging</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="multiple-floors">Multiple Floors</h2>
<p>The idea of putting the players straight into a fight with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Dragon,</a> so I think it would be cool if there were multiple floors.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Example:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Rusty Beginnings</strong></li>
<li><strong>Toppling Towers</strong></li>
<li><strong>The End...?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Not another Floor... ðŸ˜³</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Dragon</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Idea:</p>
<p>Along with the idea of multiple floors in this game, maybe we could implement a swapping floors sort of system.<br>This actually goes really well with the final idea:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="treasure-cards">Treasure Cards</h2>
<p>Since there are floors to explore in this game, maybe we could implement a card system.   </p>
<p>The idea is simple, there would be two card decks.<br>One would be called <strong>The Tool Shed</strong><br>The other would be called <strong>The Treasure Box</strong>   </p>
<p>When a player opens a treasure chest, maybe on some floor, they would pull a card out of the Treasure Box. This could be something like some rare loot, or maybe a weapon.<br>If the player defeats a tough enemy, they can pull something from the Tool shed.<br>The tool shed cards would be very useful to the Way the game works, since you have to play the card right when you draw it. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Example of <strong>Tool Shed</strong> cards:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Go To Hell!</strong> Go directly to the Dragon, but with one guy.</li>
<li><strong>Endless Pit...</strong> Everyone goes back to the first floor.</li>
<li><strong>Golden Sock!!!</strong> Everyone draws 3 <strong>Treasure Box Cards</strong></li>
<li><strong>Invincible..?</strong> Choose someone in your army, he can now avoid any debuff, but he has 1 health.</li>
<li><strong>Dragons Luck.</strong> Take 3 members of someones army.</li>
<li><strong>Jacks Debugging Tool.</strong> You can now open any door, without a key!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
