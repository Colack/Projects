1.1.2 Alpha (Test 2)

Essentially, this is just a installer test. I am attempting to fix the installer files, and next will be the actual language itself. Hopefully I don't die doing this... ðŸ˜“ 
The plan after that is regular features. We have just hit a roadblock recently with the weird file structure that I set up. I need to make the file structure less weird.
After that, the 1.1.2 update will come out, then the 1.2 update, and so on and so on. Just have to get past this weird point...
