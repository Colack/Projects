<h4 align="center">The Gold Interpreter, on the go!</h4>

The Gold-Boots interpreter is a lightweight version of the Regint for **Gold**. You can run any file by using the command:
```powershell
node ./node_modules/gold-boots/index.mjs
```
You need to have a file in the folder with the interpreter. 
The file also needs to be called **runner.mjs**.
